Sob Hackathon project

Deep Learning notes:

  -To use the neural network you should install dynet package (http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

-We are currently using a neural network called RNN-LSTM (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), we may try to use different networks later.
 
Cyber notes:

  -How to use: 
     
     The attacker.py should run on the attacker machine, victim.py should run on the metasploitable.

  -To use the attacker you should install pymetasploit package (https://github.com/allfro/pymetasploit).
